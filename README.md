My process

Built 

Vite

Semantic HTML5

Tailwind CSS – utility-first styling

React – component-based UI structure

What I learned

This project sharpened my skills in component architecture and styling using Tailwind. I learned to:

Structure reusable components like Navbar, Details, and Images

Betterment of the React Components, Props and the Hooks

Handle layout distribution using Tailwind’s flex, justify-between, and spacing utilities

Apply Tailwind’s version 4 directive to manage centralized styling in index.css

Organize my layout using grid and responsive containers for consistent spacing
Continued development
