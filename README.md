**#Commerce Product Page Solution**

This is a solution to the E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor. This challenge helped me improve my skills in React, Tailwind CSS, component structure, and responsive design by building a realistic product landing page.

**##Built  With:**

Vite

Semantic HTML5

Tailwind CSS – utility-first styling

React – component-based UI structure

Flexbox and CSS Grid

**##What I learned**

This project sharpened my skills in component architecture and styling using Tailwind. I learned to:

Structure reusable components like Navbar, Details, and Images

Betterment of the React Components, Props and the Hooks

Handle layout distribution using Tailwind’s flex, justify-between, and spacing utilities

Apply Tailwind’s version 4 directive to manage centralized styling in index.css

Organize my layout using grid and responsive containers for consistent spacing
Continued development

**##Useful resources**

[Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) – Core for layout and design

[React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)– Helped with component planning
